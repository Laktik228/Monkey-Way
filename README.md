# Monkey-Way

The Monkey Way is a 2D platformer game about a monkey with a taste for adventure. Playing as the monkey, the player's main aim is to reach the end of the jungle themed level. However, to reach the end, The Monkey must first overcome several obstacles and enemies, both of which are laid out with the same aim: The Monkey’s demise. Along the Monkey’s journey in the level, he is met by several instances of his brother species: The Evil Ninja Monkeys. These nefarious creatures might not be the brightest, but when they attack they can pack a punch. However, The Monkey is more than capable of handling these other monkeys, as he has three ‘Monkey Lives’, and has a devastating karate kick in his Arsenal. That being said, The Monkey must not delay while fighting these as the Evil Ninja Monkeys are relentless, and will continue to spawn.  While fighting these creatures is the most dangerous thing The Monkey faces on his quest, the environment around him cannot be underestimated either. In several instances it seems almost as if the jungle itself is out to get The Monkey also. Bottomless pits and a deadly river are just some of the aspects of the jungle on a mission to stop The Monkey from reaching the end of the level.
